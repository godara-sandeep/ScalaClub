PROBLEM 1 :
    Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Examples:

    Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

    Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

    Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a
    subsequence and not a substring.

PROBLEM 2 :
Reverse digits of an integer.

    Example1: x = 123, return 321
    Example2: x = -123, return -321

    Note:
    The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed 
    integer overflows.
